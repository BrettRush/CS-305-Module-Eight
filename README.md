CS 305 Module Eight


Artemis Financial, a leading financial services firm, sought to enhance the security of its software systems to safeguard sensitive client data. The client's primary concern was addressing vulnerabilities that could potentially expose confidential information to unauthorized access or cyber threats. During the vulnerability assessment, I identified and remedied critical security gaps by implementing testing practices such as input validation and encryption. One challenge I faced during the assignment was balancing thoroughness with maintaining system functionality, and ensuring that security enhancements did not affect the user experience. To enhance security, I used strategies like role-based access controls and regular security audits. In the future, I would use automated scanning tools and threat modeling techniques to assess vulnerabilities and prioritize mitigation strategies based on risk assessment frameworks. After refactoring the code, I conducted extensive testing using unit tests and penetration testing to detect any new vulnerabilities introduced during the process. Utilizing resources such as OWASP, secure coding practices, and version control systems proved instrumental in achieving both functionality and security objectives. For future assignments, I can use my abilities to effectively identify and fix software vulnerabilities.
